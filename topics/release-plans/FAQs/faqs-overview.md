# Getting started

The purpose of this guide is to create a centralized repository of useful information to help our team create high-quality and consistent release plans for our customers. Use this guide to familiarize yourself with all things related to release plans development and publication. 

> ![NOTE]
> We'll update this guide as information becomes available or as information changes. 

## What are release plans?

Release plans provide details to customers (and potential customers) about new features, upcoming features, and planned features. It is living documentation that is constantly being updated as features are being developed. It is a tool that helps us keep our users up-to-date with the latest information. 

## What's covered?

Currently, we only deal with release plans about new features, products, and capabilities within Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform. These release plans are regularly updated and published to [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/release-plans/) as both web content and a PDF.

Below are links to the active release plans:

## When are they published?

The release plans are divided into two *waves* every year. Wave 1 covers features being released from April to September, and wave 2 covers features being released from October to March. 

Each wave has regular (usually weekly) trains that consist of developing or updating content, reviewing content, editing content, and publishing content to docs.microsoft.com. About once a month, the editing team creates two PDFs of the release plans. One is for Microsoft Power Platform release plans, and the other is a combined PDF of Dynamics 365 and several Microsoft Power Platform topics. 

Go to [Production schedule](release-plans/rn-production-schedule.md) for more information.

## Who's who?

The release plans team is complex, and it can be difficult for new team members to keep track of who's who and what their roles are in the overall process. The graphic below shows how the release plans flow through each role as they're being developed.
