# Regular trains

Content is entered into the release planner app and published on a regular cadence. These are called *trains*. The updates to the release plans will follow the [production schedule](https://msit.powerbi.com/groups/fce55d85-50c2-4249-b054-60f8643ad13f/reports/0eb6f27b-2d3a-447d-9a6a-cf77f35bfbcd/ReportSection31aec9950d0006de8110).  

There are no exceptions to the regular trains with the exception of critical issues (for example, the early release of an embargo name or NDA info). 

## Where do I find the schedule for the trains/publishes? 

The [schedule](https://msit.powerbi.com/groups/fce55d85-50c2-4249-b054-60f8643ad13f/reports/0eb6f27b-2d3a-447d-9a6a-cf77f35bfbcd/ReportSection31aec9950d0006de8110) lives in the app now. You can see what's included in the next publish, the dates, and what the upcoming dates look like. There are two tabs at the bottom of the schedule so you can toggle between waves. 

## If I update my content in the app, when will it go live? 

The updates will be included in the next train, which is shown on the [schedule](https://msit.powerbi.com/groups/fce55d85-50c2-4249-b054-60f8643ad13f/reports/0eb6f27b-2d3a-447d-9a6a-cf77f35bfbcd/ReportSection31aec9950d0006de8110).

## What if I am still working on my feature, and I don't want it to be released?

Make sure the toggle for **Include in release plans** on the top of the feature is switched to *No*.
