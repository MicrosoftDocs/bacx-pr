# Late submissions

Our goal is to publish our release plans in a reliable cadence, which builds customer trust and ensures that the right information is being released at the right time. 

## If I don’t review the content in time, what will happen?
If the plan was published earlier, the existing article will continue to be available publicly with no changes. If it is a brand new topic, it won’t be published.

## I missed the deadline, but my content needs to be included in this train. Can it be published late? 
If deadlines slip, there are two possible solutions. 

1.  If the information **is not** critical to a marketing moment, the updates will come with the next regular publish.

2. If the information **is** critical to a marketing moment and must be released in conjunction with an event, then the PM must set up a meeting with the Doc Owner, Ramana, Erica, Renee, and Ann to discuss the impacts of missing the content and who is responsible for which part of that process. If a meeting is not possible, the PM or Ramana will start mail to discuss options. 
   * We (the Cpub team, Doc Writer, PM, and Chitra) will first determine if the date has to slip or if there is time to do the work. The date slipping is always an option.
   * We will set up a plan to get the missing information into the release plans per agreed timelines. This plan will be documented in the Bahnhof OneNote and shared with those working on the content. 
   * BACX Editors update GitHub. 
   * Chitra/PM will pull a PR for the fixes that need to be updated. The editors/Erica will handle it from there. 
   * Chitra/PM will update the tool with the missing information. We will want confirmation that this is complete so we can check that the sync works in the following publish. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > This may not be necessary with the new ticketing system.

> [!NOTE]
> PDF is in flight, this is not possible and there will be no updates to the PDF. It is still possible to update Docs, but it will not happen until all the other publishing tasks are complete.
