# Release planner app

## How do I move my feature from one release plan to another?

1. Click **Copy Release Plan** on the feature that you want to move.  
1. In the *copied release plan*, change the release wave to the corresponding release.   
   > ![NOTE]
   > The feature name appears with a prefix **Copy -**. Don’t forget to update it. Also, tool will prompt you to select the public preview or a GA date within the wave before saving. 

1. On the existing plan (the plan you wanted to move from), toggle the **Include in Release plan** to *No*.  
1. Set one of the following values in the removal reason:
   - Moved to the next release wave
   - Moved to the previous release wave  
With this, the release plan will be moved from the current release and properly added to the corresponding release.
1. Make sure you toggle the **Include in release plan** to *No* and provide the reason in the removal reason drop down.   
 
## How do I check to see what's changed in a feature entry?
In the entry, to go the **Related** tab. A short dropdown should appear, and select **Audit History** to show you the history of the feature.

## What do I do about the dates in the release plans if a feature is being released in different regions in a phased manner? 
Before a feature ships, use the month and year the feature is planned to ship. **Example: April 2019**

Once the features have shipped, use the day, month, and year. **Example: April 12, 2019**

If a feature is being released in different regions in a phased manner, use the date it first shipped regardless of the geo. For example, if a feature is released in Japan on April 11 and in North America on April 25, then use April 11, 2019, in the **Date** column. 

## How do I create a view?
1. Click the **Create view** button at the top of the page.
   > ![NOTE]
   > Make sure your pop-up blocker is turned off as this pops up in a separate window.
1. Select the appropriate perameters, keeping in mind that you can pare down the results by choosing additional fields (like Release Date, Owner, or Product). 
1. When you have all of your search perameters, click **Results** under the exclamation point, and you will see the results of your view. 

Views can be saved, shared, and modified. Don't forget to pin your saved view if you use it often.

## I only want my actionable item in the app. How do I get that?
You can create personal views. You can also share views with other writers.

## As a doc reviewer, can I review others' content and toggle “doc owner reviewed” to Yes?
No. The workflow will reset the field to *No* if you are not the assigned doc owner.

## If I don’t review the content on time, what will happen?
If the plan was published earlier, the existing article will continue to be available publicly with no changes. If it is a brand new topic, it won’t be published.

## How do I ensure all the uploaded images are available in GitHub?
As soon as the image is uploaded, the image will be created in GitHub (master branch). When we create the PR as part of the sync, the PR will include that image. If the image fails to upload, the **Image created** value will be set to *No*. The daily digest email (sent to the leads) will also indicate this status. 

## Can I delete and upload the image with the same name?
Deletion of an image in the tool will not delete in GitHub. The image is created in GitHub based on the image name uploaded in the tool excluding the special characters (- allowed) and noisy words. The image name in GitHub will always be in lowercase. So, uploading images with the same name will not be uploaded to GitHub.

If you want to replace the current image, you need to upload an image with a new name. If the image is referred within the feature detail, the image name should be changed. If you wish to delete the old image, the need to be deleted in GitHub.

## Questions for editors

### I see some inconsistencies in Planned features or the topic that were not part of the tool created PR. Can I update them in GitHub and expect the tool to sync them?
No. **Planned features**, **Change history**, and **TOC** are always created from the tool. Updating them in GitHub will not sync back. If you are updating an article (ms.topic: article), the following information will sync back:
- title (This will come back as Feature Name) (No special characters)
- description (This will come back as Summary) (No special characters)
- Business Value (content between < !-- bv start --> and < !-- bv end -->)
- Feature Detail (content between < !--feature detail start --> and < !--feature detail end -->)

If you are updating the overview (ms.topic: overview) or product area (L2) overview (ms.topic: structure) the following information will sync back:
- The entire content in product overview between < !--overview start--> and < !--overview end-->
- The entire content in product area (L2) overview between < !--structure start--> and < !--structure end-->
- Description in product area (L2) (No special characters)   

If you are updating an article that was not part of the PR update, the changes will not sync back because the delta sync will lock only the plans that are updated. If you are updating the content that was not locked by the tool, the reverse sync simply ignores the changes.

### How do I change the Alt Text of an image?
The alt text should be updated in the app. If the image is included within the feature detail, then it should be updated in the feature detail as well.
