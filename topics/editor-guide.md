## Levels of editing
Editing is divided into two categories, depending on the level of touch required for specific deliverables: developmental (dev) edit and copy edit.

### Copy edits
When you copy edit a topic or topics, read it from the point of view of a novice. You do not need to put yourself in the perspective of the specific audience for that content. You are looking for basic understanding and guideline adherence.
Copy editors edit for:

* Grammar, punctuation, and spelling.
* Adherence to [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700), [Dynamics 365 Writing Toolkit](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/DynDoc/AXContentResources/SitePages/Create%20new%20content.aspx), [Cloud Style Guide](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2696), and (coming soon) Dynamics 365 Style Guide.
* Correct formatting of text elements. Follow guidelines in the [BACX contributors guide](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bacx/contributors-guide?branch=master). 
* Appropriate terminology and word choice. Style guide word lists and Term Studio are resources for this.
* Compliance with Microsoft legal standards, such as use of fictitious names, product names, and trademarking. The [CELA website](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/home) is a resource for this. Also see [Fictitious names](fictitious-names.md). 
* Basic readability. If a sentence is not understandable, flag it for the CP person to revise (for example, noun stacks). Please note where there is “word salad”. But you don’t need to question whether tech terms are correct. 

### Dev edits
When you developmentally edit a topic or topics, read it from the point of view of someone who has at least some domain knowledge and technical awareness. You should put yourself in the perspective of the audience that the content is intended for and ask, will the audience understand this? You must also keep in mind the holistic user experience of this topic within the rest of the doc set. 
Dev editors edit for:

* All focus areas specified for copy edits.
* Structure.
* Organization.
* Customer experience.
* Accuracy at feature level. 
* Simplicity.
* Adherence to guidelines for global English.
* Readability, especially noun stacks and word choice–-are those tech terms the right ones for that audience and technology, product, or service?
