# SEO: How to write good meta descriptions

The meta description is an article summary that displays under page titles on the search engine results page (SERP) as well as in the Docs site search feature. It describes the benefit or intent of the article. Even though it's not crawled by search engines for rank, it helps with click-through rate.  

## Rules for meta descriptions

- Maximum of ~160 characters and minimum of ~100 characters including spaces. (Google reverted from its recent experiment with longer meta descriptions.)
- At least one full sentence that describes the page topic fully.
- Use text from the introductory paragraph of on-page copy edited for length, if it describes the article intent. 
- Write key concepts at the head of the description. 
- The introductory paragraph can often be used for the meta description by paring down the length and modifying a bit of the language.  

## Meta description examples

**Example 1**

**Current meta description**: Before you can use electronic banking, you must set up export protocols. Export protocols define the file format that is generated when you export payment history to be processed by the bank. Each line contains an export protocol identified by a code and a description. You can set up as many export protocols as necessary. You must set up an export protocol for domestic payments, international payments, SEPA payments, and non-Euro SEPA payments.  (448 characters)

**Edited meta description**: Before you can use electronic banking, you must set up export protocols. This topic explains how to set up an export protocol for various kinds of payments. (157 characters)

> [!TIP]
> The original meta description for this page is more than 400 characters. Write meta descriptions that fit character limits (~160 characters maximum), directly explain the page topic and use unique language from the on-page copy. 

**Example 2**

**Current meta description:** This SDK contains a wealth of resources, including code samples, which are designed to help you build powerful vertical applications using the Customer Engagement (on-premises) platform. It is a guide for developers writing solutions, server-side code, client applications and extensions, custom business logic, plug-ins, integration modules, custom workflow modules and more. The SDK contains an architectural overview of Customer Engagement, the entity model, security model, web services, and sample code.  (508 characters)

**Edited meta description**: This SDK contains an architectural overview of the entity model, security model, web services, and sample code for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises). (162 characters)

> [!TIP]
> In this example, the original meta description included many aspects of an ideal meta description, but it was too long. The length was reduced by removing optional phrases and tightening the overall wording. Now, the meta description will fit within character limits. 

**Example 3**

**Current meta description:** Use the VAT Rate Change Tool (28 characters)

**Edited meta description**: This topic explains how to use the VAT Rate Change tool to perform VAT rate conversions for master data, journals, and orders. (126 characters)
> [!TIP]
>In this case, the original meta description was too short to qualify as a full-fledged meta description. The edited meta description will provide more information to users and reduce the chances that a search engine will fill in the meta description field with other on-page copy.

**Example 4**

**Current meta description:** Find all the training options for administrators. (49 characters)

**Edited meta description**: Use this topic to find all of the training options that are available for Dynamics 365  administrators. (103 characters)

> [!TIP]
>The original meta description was too short and lacked detail. The new meta description fits the character limit and gives an inviting  message to users to click on the article.
