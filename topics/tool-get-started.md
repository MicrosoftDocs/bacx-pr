# Get started with the Release Planner App

The release planner app is where PMs, Doc Owners, and others can submit, modify, and track their features in the release plans.

You can find the app [here]( https://aka.ms/BAGReleaseNotes). 

To request access, contact [rntoolfeedback@microsoft.com](mailto:rntoolfeedback@microsoft.com).

## The Basics

**Home**: Returns you to the home page (Product Overview).

**Recent**: Shows the last 10 records you accessed.

**Pinned**: Hosts any pinned items including records and views. This is handy for storing things you access frequently.

### Dashboard

**Schedule**: The schedule shows the upcoming trains, the current train, and the features that will be picked up by the current publish. This is a good place to check to make sure your features will or will not be included in the next publish.

**Current release plan**: Quick access to the current release plan tracker.

### Release: 

**Product Overview**: This overview appears in the release plans. There is one per product. 

**Release Plans**: Lists every feature. 

### Release Plans Admin – most of these entries are Read Only
**Release Wave** – Lists the major releases by month and year.

**Products** – Includes BAG products, product owners, GPMs, product, marketing and content owner.

**Product Area (L2)** – This field allows you to group features (e.g., Attract, Onboard for Talent and Supply chain management).

**Product team** – Allows features to be tracked under individual team in a single product. 

**Personas** – Selected at the feature level, this will allow you to target a particular persona (IT professional, sales agent) for your feature.

**License/Plan** – If a feature requires a specific license/plan to work, they can be configured here and selected at the feature level (This is on hold for now).

### Top navigation

**New** – This creates a new blank record based on where you are in the left navigation pane. If you are in Product Overview, it will create a blank product overview, or if you are in the Product Area (L2), it will create one there, and so on.

**Refresh** – Updates the app so you can view the current iteration of your work.

**Email a link** – Select the items you want to send (you can send multiple) and you can email a link to your chosen records.

**Create a view** – This allows you to filter features to focus on what you need to see. More on creating a view [here]<!--need link.-->
