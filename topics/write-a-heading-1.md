# SEO: Tips for writing a heading 1 (H1)

The H1 (heading 1) HTML tag is the first heading at the top of a page. The H1 has the second greatest impact on search ranking and the greatest impact on on-page relevance.  

Like the title tag in metadata, the H1 must quickly communicate the intent of the article: What a customer can learn or accomplish with the article.

One of the most complicated tasks of search engines is to understand the meaning and content of a page. In order to achieve that, the crawler uses different signals, one of which is the content in H1 tag. Using relevant keywords in the H1 helps search engines understand the intent of the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't confuse the H1 with the title tag; they are two different text elements. The H1 displays at the top of the article and has a limit of 100 characters including spaces. The title tag is in article metadata and displays in the browser bar and on the search engine result page.

## Rules for writing H1s

- Every page must have a single H1. Don't use more than one H1 per page.

    It is OK to incorporate multiple H2 and H3 tags on a page.

- The H1 tag is at the top of the page and listed before any subheadings (H2 and H3 tags).
- Echo the language and intent from the title tag. 
    
    Because the H1 allows more characters than a title, it can be more descriptive.

- Ensure that every page has a unique H1 tag that is informative and specific to the on-page copy. 
    
   - Don't use the same H1 on two or more pages.
   - If content is deemed similar between both pages and cannot be differentiated, consider determining a primary page between all alike pages and canonicalize all secondary pages to the primary page using a canonical tag.

- Include primary keyword(s) in the H1 tag to maximize intent and SEO value.
- Ensure that the H1 isn't generic; it needs to communicate a specific intent.
- Don't substitute bold or italicized text for heading tags. 

## H1 example

**Conversational H1** Assign Delivery Reminder Codes to Vendors   (this H1 is used twice in the same repo)

**Edited H1** Assign Delivery Reminder Codes to Vendors (Austria) |  Assign Delivery Reminder Codes to Vendors (Germany)
           
> [!TIP]
> The current H1 tag is used two times in the same repo. In order to prevent this from occuring, adding the country that the topic applies to makes each H1 unique.
