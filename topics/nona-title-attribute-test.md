# Add geospatial components to your app


You can add a number of geospatial components to your canvas app to support scenarios that involve mapping locations and addresses. *Components* are groups of controls that can answer the need for a specific scenario. You can read more about components and how to build your own in the Power Apps developer library.

The following prebuilt components can be used for geospatial and mapping scenarios:

- [Interactive map](permission-levels.md)
- [Address input](review-links.md)

The following image call is the usual kind:

![Create branch with alt text and title attribute](media/create-branch-01.png "Create branch with alt text and title attribute")

This is the image extension recommended by DocOps so we can have really long ("complex") alt text:

:::image type="content" source="media/create-branch-01.png" alt-text="alt text":::

Here's an attempt to add the title attribute. Maybe I just don't know how it's done. First one says `title="alt text repeated here"`

:::image type="content" source="media/create-branch-01.png" alt-text="alt text" title="alt text repeated here":::

This one says `title-text="alt text repeated here"`

:::image type="content" source="media/create-branch-01.png" alt-text="alt text" title-text="alt text repeated here":::
