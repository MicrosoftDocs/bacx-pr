# Production schedule

The Release plans are regularly updated and published to [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/). 

The production schedule can be found [here](https://msit.powerbi.com/groups/fce55d85-50c2-4249-b054-60f8643ad13f/reports/0eb6f27b-2d3a-447d-9a6a-cf77f35bfbcd/ReportSection31aec9950d0006de8110).

# Late submission guidelines

Our goal is to publish our release plans in a reliable cadence. It builds customer trust, and ensures that the right information is released at the right time. If deadlines slip, the following process will be adhered to:

1. Weekly train/regular update
  
The content will be published on the following train. There are no exceptions except with critical issues (the early release of a embargo name or NDA info).

If the issue is deemed critical, the following people will be notified: PM, Doc Owner, Ramana, Erica, Renee, and Ann. This group will collectively determine if we let the publish date slip, or if we move it through the process.
  
2. Marketing moment/annoucement 

We have two possible solutions: 

  1. If the information is critical to the marketing moment or announcement, and must be released in conjunction with an event, then the PM or Ramana must set up a meeting with the Doc Owner, Ramana, Erica, Renee, and Ann to discuss the impacts of missing that content and who is responsible for what part of that process. If a meeting is not possible, the PM or Ramana will start mail to discuss the options. 
- We (the Cpub team, Doc Writer, PM, and Ramana) will first determine if the date has to slip or if there is time to do the work. _The date slipping is always an option._
- We will set up a plan to get the missing information into the release plans per agreed timelines. This plan will be documented in the Bahnhof OneNote and shared with those working on the content.  
- BACX Editors update GitHub. 
- Ramana/PM will pull a PR for the fixes that need to be updated. The editors/Erica will handle it from there. 
- Ramana/PM will update the tool with the missing information. We will want confirmation that this is complete so we can check that the sync works in the following publish. _note This may not be necessary with the new ticketing system_ 
			
_Note: If the PDF is in flight, this is not possible and there will be no updates to the PDF. It is still possible to update Docs, but it will not happen until all the other publishing tasks are complete._  
			
- If the information is not critical for the marketing moment, the updates will come with the next regular publish. 

3. Other important publishing event

This will be determined in a case-by-case basis, but once we are notified of an important publishing moment, we will outline when the date can slip and when to push the missing work through the publishing process.
