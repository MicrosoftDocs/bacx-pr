# When to update the ms.date metadata

Here are some general guidelines about when you need to update ms.date metadata for an existing topic. The goal is to change the date so it’s clear how fresh the topic is and -- if a user has read the topic before, the date indicates a significant change. In other words, the date indicates freshness to new readers and potentially (if they remember when they read it last) a signal to previous readers it’s worth reading again. We also use this date for reporting purposes.

Do update ms.date if you make major changes to an existing topic. Major changes include when you: 

- Add or delete multiple paragraphs. 
- Change the organization or structure of content.
- Change key details about the subject of the topic, such as you add a new important alert or steps in a procedure need to be fixed so users can be successful. 
- Add or delete legal information, such as an alert about privacy or data loss, or remove the preview or early access include/banner.
- Add new art or embed a video.

Do NOT update ms.date if you’ve made minor changes. Minor changes include when you:

- Update links. 
- Make copy edit changes, such as fixes for typos, punctuation, or grammar.
- Add or delete a few words or sentences.
