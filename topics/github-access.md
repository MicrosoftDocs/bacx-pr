# Request guest access to GitHub repos

Update your GitHub account by signing in to GitHub, selecting the Profile drop-down list in the upper-right corner, and then selecting Settings. Under Emails, change your primary account to your non-MS email alias. Under Organizations, select Leave to remove yourself from MicrosoftDocs. 

Once your MS account is no longer on the corporate network, let Buckley (buckley.guderian@microsoft.com) know which GitHub repos you need access to and what your non-Microsoft alias is. He can add you as an outside collaborator. 

When he adds you, you’ll receive an email invitation for each requested repo. All you have to do is accept the invitation. After that, you should be able to use GitHub like before, except you won’t be able to merge PRs. Your GitHub alias won’t change.

Buckley also will re-add you to the MicrosoftDocs org.
