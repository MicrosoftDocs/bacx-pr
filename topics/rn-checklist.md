# Checklist: Before you merge a PR

Merging PRs now falls primarily to the team's editors. 

Editors or anyone else merging a PR should use this checklist to make sure all the necessary consistency changes to the release plan topics are complete:

- If the PR removes or renames a topic (**April '19 or earlier**), make sure a redirect has been set up. Here are the instructions for doc owners on [Deleting or renaming topic files](delete-rename.md).

- If the PR adds or removes a topic, or renames a topic, make sure that change is reflected in the TOC, change history, and planned features. 

- If a topic's release date changes, make sure it's reflected in the change history.

- Make sure the ms.date value is updated to reflect the date of the change.

- Make sure the right authors are listed for ms.author, author, and ms.reviewer.
