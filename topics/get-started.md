# Contributors guide: Get started

Our content is hosted on GitHub. Complete the following steps to get started
with contributing or editing content in our docs repos on
GitHub.

## Create GitHub account and join our org

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Folks who already contribute content to our repos donâ€™t have to perform the **first
two** steps again. Also, this is just a one-time setup.

1.  [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) using your
    **\@Microsoft.com** email with 2-Factor Auth enabled.  
    If you already have a GitHub account, ensure that you change/set the primary
    email ID as your **\@Microsoft.com** email.<br/>
    You must ensure that your GitHub profile info adheres to the profile requirements listed in the next section. 

2.  Join the **MicrosoftDocs** org:
    <https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/MicrosoftDocs>

3.  Request write access to [our repos](#our-repos) by joining the following group:
    <https://github.com/orgs/MicrosoftDocs/teams/bacx-contribute/members> <br> As an alternative, you can also go to https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/MicrosoftDocs > **Teams** tab > Search for **bacx-contribute** MicrosoftDocs Team > Submit the join request.

> [!CAUTION]
> You must print or save your recovery codes so that you can
access your account in the event you lose access to your device and cannot
receive two-factor authentication codes. Your recovery codes are available here:
<https://github.com/settings/auth/recovery-codes>
